Given a sorted array (ar) and a number (V), can you print the index location of V in the array?

{The next section describes the input format. You can often skip it, if you are using included methods. }

Input Format
There will be three lines of input:

    V - the value that has to be searched.
    n - the size of the array.
    ar - n numbers that make up the array.

Output Format
Output the index of V in the array.

{The next section describes the constraints and ranges of the input. You should check this section to know the range of the input. }

Constraints
1<=n<=1000
-1000 <=x <= 1000 , x âˆˆ ar

{This "sample" shows the first input test case. It is often useful to go through the sample to understand a challenge. }

Sample Input

4
6
1 4 5 7 9 12

Sample Output

1

Explanation
V = 4. The 4 is located in the 1st spot on the array, so the answer is 1.
